The **SpotyPee** project creates a specialized Linux distribution which allows you to upgrade your old sound system with Spotify as a additional source for your music.

You need:

- Raspberry Pi 3 with power supply
- [UGREEN USB Audio 3.5mm](https://www.ugreen.com/products/2-in-1-usb-external-sound-card?lang=de)
- 4GB Micro SD-Card

The build system is in a Docker Container encapsulated and can run on a Windows, Mac or, of course, linux powered host.
